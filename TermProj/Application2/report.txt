For application 2, I used an array with a size of 3000 with students inserted in positions corresponding to their ID number, since every ID is unique. As a result, every function can run in constant time with the exception of CreateDataSet, which takes O(n). 
createDataSet: O(n)
destroyDataSet: O(1)
searchID: O(1)
insertion: O(1)
deletion: O(1)
